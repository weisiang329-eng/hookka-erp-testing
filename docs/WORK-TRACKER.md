# Hookka ERP — Work Tracker

Durable, cross-session list of assigned / in-progress / shipped work so nothing is
forgotten. **Newest first. Update on every state change** (assigned → in progress →
shipped/parked). Re-read this + `MEMORY.md` at the start of each session and before
reporting "done". See `docs/DEV-OPERATING-FRAMEWORK.md` for the discipline.

Status key: 🔵 in progress · 🟡 parked/needs owner · ✅ shipped to prod · ⚪ queued

### ⏸️ AWAITING OWNER — 3 decisions to finish the purchasing batch
- **① PI import** — Excel reconcile done: all 15 Excel POs already in system; **19 PIs missing** (PI-2604-019→037, OCEAN SKY, RM 7,258, no PO link → manual). Plan: one-time import preserving original PI# + status APPROVED + supplier invoice#/DO#.
- **② J cleanup** — delete ~1665 pre-1-Apr docs (PO 555 / GRN 555 / PI 555): (a) docs only, or (b) docs + their stock batches + cost ledger? Destructive → needs a one-time script (option-A lock blocks normal delete). Snapshot first.
- **③ GRN no-draft** — imports-in-transit use the arrival pipeline (Planning→Arrived) instead of Draft; local goods → direct create + post. OK?

### ✅ Effective-dated supplier pricing + Price Change Log + Supplier Quotation PDF (G/H) — shipped main `ba306a41` (effective_from, append-only price_histories, PDF matches Customer Quotation).

### ✅ Purchasing create: no-draft (PO/PI) + supplier reference numbers — shipped main `8374fc6d`
- ✅ **PART 1 — no-Draft on manual create** (owner: manual → active; only OCR → Draft, like SO).
  - **PO create** (`procurement/create.tsx`): button "Save as Draft"→"Create Purchase Order";
    payload sends `status: "CONFIRMED"` (POST takes body.status verbatim, else DRAFT). Split-by-Supplier
    groups also CONFIRMED. Summary hint → "Status will be set to CONFIRMED". PO has no OCR path.
  - **PI create** (`procurement/pi/create.tsx`): manual → `PENDING_APPROVAL` (first non-DRAFT in
    purchase-invoices.ts VALID_TRANSITIONS); OCR/scan (`?scan=1` deep-link OR in-form Scan modal's
    applyOcr) flips `ocrUsed`→DRAFT. Button "Create Invoice" unchanged. Convert-from-GRN/PO prefill =
    PENDING_APPROVAL (operator-initiated, not OCR). Convert chain (line guard + grnItemId increment)
    unaffected — status-independent.
- ✅ **PART 2 — supplier reference numbers** (snake_case + runtime self-apply + migration file + SQLite mirror):
  - `grns.supplier_do_no` (ensureGrnMigrations); `purchase_invoices.supplier_do_no` +
    `purchase_invoices.supplier_invoice_no` (ensurePiMigrations). Migration files
    `migrations-postgres/0183` + `migrations/0105`.
  - FE: "Supplier DO No." on GRN create + GRN detail (inline edit via main PUT); "Supplier Invoice No."
    + "Supplier DO No." on PI create + PI detail (edit-mode, DRAFT-only). Read dual-keyed. Persist
    through create + edit (GRN main PUT + PI PUT both extended).
- tsc clean (only 3 known jsbarcode/@zxing). `npm test` 1010 pass / 0 fail. **NOT pushed** (worktree commit only).

### 🔵 IN FLIGHT — parallel agents (owner: "全部做完，不要紧" + ultracode; review+test+confirm before prod)
- ✅ **Convert-chain backend foundation** — line-level invoice guard (partial/2nd PI ok, blocks over-draw) + per-line `availableQty` + `grn_item_id` link + **OPTION A** (owner: received/POSTED GRN LOCKED from delete+un-post → no stock-reversal hole). 17 tests. Shipped main `97a69de6`; **verified live** (DELETE posted GRN → 409). postGRNToStock untouched.
- ✅ **P2 convert UX** — `convert-from-po-modal` (GRN) + `convert-to-pi-modal` (PI, GRN+PO tabs, carries grnItemId); picks show availableQty + clamp ≤ available; GRN "From PO|Manual" toggle DROPPED (manual default + PO-linked banner). Shipped main `77ed0013`; verified live (availableQty + grn item id exposed). 1010 tests.
- ⚪ **P3 multi-source** — multi-GRN→1 PI is close (per-line grnItemId already supports it; needs picker UI). **多PO→1 GRN needs SCHEMA** (grns.poId single-column → per-line PO source) = high-risk, own branch.
- ⚪ **P4 PI→COGS cascade** — highest-risk cost cascade; own branch + owner buy-in.
- ✅ **Supplier Price History → PO view + filter/sort** — shipped `774ed7ff` (suppliers/detail.tsx).
- ✅ **GRN arrival DO-parity** — Planning rename + forward jumps (FE+BE) + DO tab layout. Shipped `dc6a880a`.
- ✅ **Price Comparison multi-select + cross-material** — multi-select, A-vs-B table, badge legend, filter+sort. Shipped `e695c3c1`.
- **NEXT after backend lands:** P2 convert UX (Convert-from buttons + line-pick pickers, drop GRN Manual toggle), P3 multi-doc consolidation endpoints, P4 PI→COGS cascade.

- 🔵 **PURCHASING CONVERT-CHAIN ALIGNMENT (the big one, owner directive + 2990 ref)** — owner wants
  Hookka's PO→GRN→PI (+PO→PI) to match 2990: create & convert = SAME page; a top-right **"Convert from
  <upstream>"** button (GRN→From PO, PI→From Goods Receipt/PO) that PRE-FILLS; manual = blank default
  (NO "From PO|Manual" toggle); every add/delete line must cascade to INVENTORY. **High-risk (inventory
  cascade) → investigate→propose→confirm + isolated branch.** Study agent `a9320f47` reading 2990 fe+be
  + Hookka gap → will return a plan. This SUPERSEDES the earlier GRN "Manual (no PO)" toggle.
- ✅ **PI/GRN/PO line-picker dropdown clip FIXED** — MaterialPicker dropdown was absolute → clipped by
  the rounded `overflow-hidden` items-table wrapper (owner: "drop down 还没展开完"). Portaled to <body>
  (fixed pos, scroll/resize tracked). tsc+tests, shipped `1dc8e361`.
- ✅ **Supplier Batch Edit** (task #54 follow-up) — upgraded grid Batch Edit to sofa-combos pattern:
  useConfirm + 4 fields (payment terms / company / status / rating). Agent `cc0e3fa3`, cherry-picked, shipped `2cbade89`.
- ✅ **Supplier Quotation PDF** — found ALREADY built (`generate-supplier-quotation-pdf.ts` + button on
  supplier detail, shared letterhead). Parked item was stale; nothing to do.
- ✅ **Purchasing Phase D — lineage SmartButtons** — new `PurchaseLineageBar` on PO/GRN/PI detail
  (PO→GRN→PI clickable, counts, client-side derived, read-only). Agent `c91834df`, cherry-picked, shipped `2cbade89`.
- ✅ **GRN list: arrival chips fixed + explicit From PO entry** — (1) arrival filter chips were
  misaligned (dot used `<Badge variant=status>` which renders the status TEXT in a 6px dot →
  overflow/overlap); swapped for a plain `getStatusColor(state).hex` dot. (2) Header only showed
  "Create GRN" though create.tsx already defaults to PO mode → added explicit **From PO / Manual
  Receipt (`?manual=1`) / Scan GRN**. tsc clean, shipped `5bcbbcd3`, **verified live** (chips clean,
  3 buttons present). Found via owner screenshot; fixed via NAVIGATION-MAP (Procurement module).

## 2026-06-20

- ✅ **CoE / Dev-Efficiency System built** — the "big plan" ([DEV-EFFICIENCY-SYSTEM.md](DEV-EFFICIENCY-SYSTEM.md)):
  Layer 4 **Navigation** = [NAVIGATION-MAP.md](context-packs/NAVIGATION-MAP.md) (**15 modules = full system
  coverage**, line-range index for ~30 monster files, spot-verified); Layer 5 **Methodology** = [PLAYBOOKS.md](PLAYBOOKS.md)
  (8 procedures); 9 Codex docs tailored; DOCS-INDEX surfaces all. **Still optional:** light docs reorg
  (merge UI-DATA-DOCUMENT-STANDARDS→UI-CONVENTIONS), Data-dictionary/glossary, ERD map, Test-selection matrix.
- ✅ **#3 / GRN read-bug fix** — dual-key read for snake_case cols folded to camelCase by
  `toCamel`. Shipped `cdfcae69`. **VERIFIED LIVE 2026-06-20:** create→read→delete round-trip on
  prod (`PO-2606-006` throwaway) → `materialCode` stored as "VERIFY-CODE-001" and **read back
  correctly** (was "" before the fix), name clean, deleted 200. GRN arrival reads dual-keyed too.
- ✅ **Employees summary stale-on-date FIX** (task #55) — wired all 6 date-bearing tabs
  (handleSummaryDateChange + onDateChange prop on Efficiency/Dept-Labor/Employee-Detail/
  Dept-Performance/Labor-Cost). Done myself via NAVIGATION-MAP (read ~250 lines not 10,951).
  tsc clean, shipped `4157cf88`, verified-live (renders clean). **SWEEP DONE (2026-06-21, CLEAN):**
  audited dashboard-b month switcher, reports, daily-report, analytics, ~10 accounting date-tabs,
  planning — all correctly put the date in the URL/deps → react. **Employees was the only real
  instance.** 2 minor non-same-class notes: reports.tsx "Generate" gate (change-date-forget-to-click
  → stale display, intentional UX); accounting AR cards mount-once (no date picker). **Task #55 DONE.**
- ✅ **Supplier Pricing → Supplier merge** (task #54) — cherry-picked `5064505c` onto main
  ([Suppliers | Price Comparison] tabs in maintenance.tsx; supplier detail [Pricing & SKUs |
  Price History]; nav "Suppliers"→maintenance; `/procurement/pricing` redirects). Reviewed diff:
  ComparisonTab was PORTED from pricing.tsx → **deleted the now-dead pricing.tsx** so there's one
  comparison surface (no drift). tsc clean. Shipped `b3b42b6c`. **TODO left: verify-live.**
- ✅ **Dev Operating Framework + Work Tracker** — this doc set + the 快准省 / review-
  discipline answer + durable tracking cadence. Committed.
- ✅ **Codex docs read + efficiency framework adopted** — read all context-packs +
  LLM-CONTEXT-STRATEGY + AI-DEVELOPMENT-MODES; saved smallest-mode discipline to memory.

## Parked — needs owner one-line confirm (from 2026-06-18 queue)

- 🟡 Supplier inline **Batch Edit** in grid (scope ambiguous).
- 🟡 Supplier **quotation export / print** (scope ambiguous).
- 🟡 Purchasing **Phase D** — document-flow lineage / SmartButtons (deferred).
