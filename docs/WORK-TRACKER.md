# Hookka ERP — Work Tracker

Durable, cross-session list of assigned / in-progress / shipped work so nothing is
forgotten. **Newest first. Update on every state change** (assigned → in progress →
shipped/parked). Re-read this + `MEMORY.md` at the start of each session and before
reporting "done". See `docs/DEV-OPERATING-FRAMEWORK.md` for the discipline.

Status key: 🔵 in progress · 🟡 parked/needs owner · ✅ shipped to prod · ⚪ queued

## 2026-06-23

### ✅ Audit Log — search box + "who" (actor name) · #10 (→ main)
Owner #10. (1) The **By** column now shows the actor's **name**, not a raw user id: `/audit-log` (`accounting.ts`) resolves the distinct `actorUserId`s → `users.displayName` (one `IN (...)` lookup) and returns `actorName` per row. (2) New **search box** on `AuditLogTab` — client-side filter over the ≤1000 loaded rows (reference / party / who / type / state). `AuditRow` gains `actorName?`; dynamic empty-state message. tsc clean, eslint clean, 1136/1137 tests. Read-only, low-risk → main.

### ✅ Sales-invoice "create-as-SENT doesn't post" — VERIFIED NO BUG (no change)
Checked all 4 invoice-create paths: `invoices.ts:1116` (manual from-DO) + `consignment-notes.ts:1213` (CN→invoice) create **DRAFT** (post on the PUT DRAFT→SENT transition); `delivery-orders.ts:908` (auto-on-delivery) + `:2142` (re-issue) create **SENT** and post in the SAME batch via `buildInvoiceLedgerLegs(..., itemsOverride)`. **No path creates SENT without posting** — unlike PI (whose POST accepted `body.status=APPROVED`, set by the import). The memory's "invoice is symmetric" assumption was wrong; corrected. Nothing to fix.

### ✅ PI created-as-APPROVED now posts to GL (bug fix → main) · `BUG-2026-06-23-007`
Root cause: `purchase-invoices.ts` only posted GL legs on a PUT status *transition* to APPROVED; the POST handler never posted. So a PI born APPROVED (bulk import / any create-as-APPROVED) fed Creditor Aging but not the ledger → 400-0000 drifted below aging (prod: 56 APPROVED PIs RM 75,340 in aging, 1 in GL). Fix: new pure `src/lib/pi-posting.ts buildPiApprovalLegs()` (DR buckets · CR 400-0000, balances) + 6 unit tests; POST posts on create-as-APPROVED (idempotent via `ledgerHasSource`, same atomic batch); PUT refactored onto the same helper (byte-identical, no drift). Opening PIs (`/opening-balance/ap`, isOpening) unaffected; history not retroactively posted (→ owner reconciliation). Backend-only; no operational module touched. build:strict clean, 1080/1081 tests, adversarial money-review SAFE (7/7). **NEXT: symmetric sales-invoice (DRAFT→SENT) fix.** Owner acceptance: create APPROVED PI → check Trial Balance / AP control.

### Mega-message backlog (owner, late 2026-06-23) — Production / Dispatch / Worker UX
- ✅ **Apply Completion single-row revert** — owner: "一个个按本来就没事,别动它". Reverted the forceShow change on the per-row completion + Status-cell paths; restored exact prior behaviour; kept ONLY the batch multi-select fix (BUG-2026-06-23-004). tsc 0 → main (741f5fa0).
- ✅ **Customer email — live prod check** — read 199 DOs on prod: **0 have any deliveredEmailAt/dispatchEmailAt** → customer-notify NEVER actually fired (dispatch OR invoice). Validates the backend-choke-point fix (already merged). No outbox GET endpoint exists. Historical 199 NOT auto-resent. Awaiting owner: do ONE real dispatch/invoice (I watch the stamp live) OR use the resend button (building).
- 🔵 **Production Overview — search by Customer PO returns nothing** (dept tabs DO find it) + **overdue chip should CLEAR search/customer/category and show full N** (owner: clicking red should pop the N, not make me clear the search first). Workflow wf_92a58d9f-c75 FAILED on transient API 500s → re-dispatching.
- ⚪ **Pending-Dispatch QR scan popup UI** (scan PL/DO QR → item list, e.g. DO-2606-072): show (1) **Customer PO** in the header, (2) per item **Product SKU = our Product Code** (e.g. 1013-(K)) **+ colour/fabric** (e.g. PC151-01). Example: "PO2605-123 · SO2606-133 · 1013(K) · Fabrics: PC151-01".
- ⚪ **Production Schedule PRINT must use the SAVED layout** — once owner sets columns + "Save as Production Schedule", every "Print Schedule" should print THAT saved column layout (not the current on-screen view); operator shouldn't hand-hide columns each print. ALSO verify "Save as Org Default" / "Reset to Org Default" actually work.
- ⚪ **Barcode (Print Schedule)** — (a) rename the "Scan" column → **"Barcode"**; (b) printed barcodes too THICK/LONG → only 6 items/page (30 items = many pages) AND insensitive/hard to scan ("scan 到半死都 scan 不到"). Redesign: compact + reliably scannable + more per page.
- 🟡 **Production STICKER component-type label (MISSED on first pass — added after owner flagged dropped tasks)** — on the printed per-job-card production stickers (the SO-2605-302-01 cards with QR + Fab Cut/Fab Sew + Qty), the bottom-right should clearly state WHAT PART this sticker is for: **HB / Armrest / Base / Divan / Cushion / Leg** etc. Owner asked "給我設計你會怎麽做" → propose a DESIGN first (mockup), get OK, then build. Component is derivable from the WIP/piece string (reuse the existing piece derivation).
- 🔵 **Catalog photos** — owner CHOSE: collapse same-family variants into ONE base tile (e.g. 1003 covers 1003 / 1003(A) / 1003(A)(HF)(W) + sizes), click tile → see variants, ONE family-level photo applies to all. Dispatched wf_6ed2a0bc-f17 (products/, parallel-safe). Feature → decide main vs staging at merge.
- ❌ **#54 Supplier Pricing merge — DROPPED** — owner: doesn't recognise it / not needed. Removed from scope.
- 🟢 **Announcement** — owner asked how workers see it / does it pop up. Current build = banner on worker phone home screen when they OPEN the app (no web-push). Offered: forced popup-on-open if wanted.

### ✅ JV account picker dropdown un-clipped (bug fix → main)
Owner screenshot: New Journal Entry line **Account** picker cut off after ~3 rows (CAPITAL / RETAINED EARNING / RESERVES). Root cause = `<div className="overflow-x-auto">` wrapping the JV lines table → `overflow-x:auto` forces `overflow-y:auto` → clipped the `absolute` AccountPicker dropdown. Fix = drop the wrapper (`accounting/index.tsx` ~L2493), matching OD/OC (bare table) / PV-OR (`w-80`) / labour (grid). Swept all 9 AccountPicker sites on the page — JV was the last clipped one. `BUG-2026-06-23-006`. tsc clean. → main.
- *Incidental:* paid down one pre-existing lint error blocking the gate on this file — `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (eslint-plugin-react-hooks v7) on the debtor/creditor ledger fetch effect (L5219, from today's `52fbe419` merge, which skipped the pre-commit hook). Targeted justified `eslint-disable-next-line` (standard `useCallback` data-load reused by the Refresh button; no behavior change).

## 2026-06-22

### 🔵 Mail Center — Gmail-style redesign with toggles (worktree, feature; do NOT push/merge)
Owner showed Gmail screenshots; asked for ALL of:
1. Compact single-line conversation rows (checkbox · star · unread dot · **Sender** · Subject — snippet … date right; hover row actions; tighter rows; unread distinct). Toggle = density compact/comfortable.
2. Category tabs above list: All / Primary / Notifications. CLIENT-SIDE heuristic over fetched rows (no backend cols). Toggle = show/hide tabs.
3. Reading-pane toggle: split (list + right pane, current) vs full-width list (row opens detail route). Persist in localStorage.
4. Cleaner Gmail-like visual polish; keep left nav functional (Inbox/Starred/Sent/Archive/Drafts/Trash/All + Labels + Departments/Mailboxes).
PLUS a master toggle Gmail-view vs Classic-view OR per-feature toggles ARE the "可以开关" (document choice).
PRESERVE ALL behaviour: reply/forward/star/unread/archive/trash, labels, Assign to, mailbox+dept scoping, unread counts, search, pagination, ~300 conversations. No API-contract change. build:strict must pass; UI 100% English.

### 🔵 F6 T4b — wire FIFO engine into P&L (branch `f6-material-fifo`, only `src/api/routes/accounting.ts`)
- New `loadMaterialCost(db, orgId, startIso, endIso)` → `{rmGroups[], wipOpenSen, wipCloseSen, fgOpenSen, fgCloseSen, warnings}` using the verified engine (`computeMaterialPeriod`/`rollupByGroup`/`valueIssues`).
- RM: opening (material_opening_stock) + GRN receipts (PI-weighted-avg if APPROVED PI else grn_items.unit_price) + cost_ledger RM_ISSUE/ADJUSTMENT, post-cutover, same-date receipts before issues.
- WIP: per-PO Σ FIFO issue cost (ref=PO) + LABOR_POSTED for POs in-progress as-of-D (date reconstruction).
- FG: per completed-not-delivered batch, FIFO unit cost = (PO FIFO material@completion + labor@completion)/original_qty × undelivered-qty-as-of-D (fg_units.delivered_at).
- Swap rmGroups/wip/fg values in computePnlWindow to loadMaterialCost; keep 704-x excluded from GL bands.

### ⏸️ AWAITING OWNER — 3 decisions to finish the purchasing batch
- ✅ **① PI import DONE** — Excel reconcile: all 15 Excel POs already present; 19 PIs were missing (PI-2604-019→037, OCEAN SKY, RM 7,258) → imported via a piNo-override on the PI POST (commit `95bfd036`), preserving original numbers + status APPROVED + supplier Inv#/DO# + items. Verified live (19/19 present+APPROVED, line counts + amounts match Excel). Total PIs 592→611.
- **② J cleanup** — delete ~1665 pre-1-Apr docs (PO 555 / GRN 555 / PI 555): (a) docs only, or (b) docs + their stock batches + cost ledger? Destructive → needs a one-time script (option-A lock blocks normal delete). Snapshot first.
- **③ GRN no-draft** — imports-in-transit use the arrival pipeline (Planning→Arrived) instead of Draft; local goods → direct create + post. OK?

### ✅ Effective-dated supplier pricing + Price Change Log + Supplier Quotation PDF (G/H) — shipped main `ba306a41` (effective_from, append-only price_histories, PDF matches Customer Quotation).

### ✅ Purchasing create: no-draft (PO/PI) + supplier reference numbers — shipped main `8374fc6d`
- ✅ **PART 1 — no-Draft on manual create** (owner: manual → active; only OCR → Draft, like SO).
  - **PO create** (`procurement/create.tsx`): button "Save as Draft"→"Create Purchase Order";
    payload sends `status: "CONFIRMED"` (POST takes body.status verbatim, else DRAFT). Split-by-Supplier
    groups also CONFIRMED. Summary hint → "Status will be set to CONFIRMED". PO has no OCR path.
  - **PI create** (`procurement/pi/create.tsx`): manual → `PENDING_APPROVAL` (first non-DRAFT in
    purchase-invoices.ts VALID_TRANSITIONS); OCR/scan (`?scan=1` deep-link OR in-form Scan modal's
    applyOcr) flips `ocrUsed`→DRAFT. Button "Create Invoice" unchanged. Convert-from-GRN/PO prefill =
    PENDING_APPROVAL (operator-initiated, not OCR). Convert chain (line guard + grnItemId increment)
    unaffected — status-independent.
- ✅ **PART 2 — supplier reference numbers** (snake_case + runtime self-apply + migration file + SQLite mirror):
  - `grns.supplier_do_no` (ensureGrnMigrations); `purchase_invoices.supplier_do_no` +
    `purchase_invoices.supplier_invoice_no` (ensurePiMigrations). Migration files
    `migrations-postgres/0183` + `migrations/0105`.
  - FE: "Supplier DO No." on GRN create + GRN detail (inline edit via main PUT); "Supplier Invoice No."
    + "Supplier DO No." on PI create + PI detail (edit-mode, DRAFT-only). Read dual-keyed. Persist
    through create + edit (GRN main PUT + PI PUT both extended).
- tsc clean (only 3 known jsbarcode/@zxing). `npm test` 1010 pass / 0 fail. **NOT pushed** (worktree commit only).

### 🔵 IN FLIGHT — parallel agents (owner: "全部做完，不要紧" + ultracode; review+test+confirm before prod)
- ✅ **Convert-chain backend foundation** — line-level invoice guard (partial/2nd PI ok, blocks over-draw) + per-line `availableQty` + `grn_item_id` link + **OPTION A** (owner: received/POSTED GRN LOCKED from delete+un-post → no stock-reversal hole). 17 tests. Shipped main `97a69de6`; **verified live** (DELETE posted GRN → 409). postGRNToStock untouched.
- ✅ **P2 convert UX** — `convert-from-po-modal` (GRN) + `convert-to-pi-modal` (PI, GRN+PO tabs, carries grnItemId); picks show availableQty + clamp ≤ available; GRN "From PO|Manual" toggle DROPPED (manual default + PO-linked banner). Shipped main `77ed0013`; verified live (availableQty + grn item id exposed). 1010 tests.
- ⚪ **P3 multi-source** — multi-GRN→1 PI is close (per-line grnItemId already supports it; needs picker UI). **多PO→1 GRN needs SCHEMA** (grns.poId single-column → per-line PO source) = high-risk, own branch.
- ⚪ **P4 PI→COGS cascade** — highest-risk cost cascade; own branch + owner buy-in.
- ✅ **Supplier Price History → PO view + filter/sort** — shipped `774ed7ff` (suppliers/detail.tsx).
- ✅ **GRN arrival DO-parity** — Planning rename + forward jumps (FE+BE) + DO tab layout. Shipped `dc6a880a`.
- ✅ **Price Comparison multi-select + cross-material** — multi-select, A-vs-B table, badge legend, filter+sort. Shipped `e695c3c1`.
- **NEXT after backend lands:** P2 convert UX (Convert-from buttons + line-pick pickers, drop GRN Manual toggle), P3 multi-doc consolidation endpoints, P4 PI→COGS cascade.

- 🔵 **PURCHASING CONVERT-CHAIN ALIGNMENT (the big one, owner directive + 2990 ref)** — owner wants
  Hookka's PO→GRN→PI (+PO→PI) to match 2990: create & convert = SAME page; a top-right **"Convert from
  <upstream>"** button (GRN→From PO, PI→From Goods Receipt/PO) that PRE-FILLS; manual = blank default
  (NO "From PO|Manual" toggle); every add/delete line must cascade to INVENTORY. **High-risk (inventory
  cascade) → investigate→propose→confirm + isolated branch.** Study agent `a9320f47` reading 2990 fe+be
  + Hookka gap → will return a plan. This SUPERSEDES the earlier GRN "Manual (no PO)" toggle.
- ✅ **PI/GRN/PO line-picker dropdown clip FIXED** — MaterialPicker dropdown was absolute → clipped by
  the rounded `overflow-hidden` items-table wrapper (owner: "drop down 还没展开完"). Portaled to <body>
  (fixed pos, scroll/resize tracked). tsc+tests, shipped `1dc8e361`.
- ✅ **Supplier Batch Edit** (task #54 follow-up) — upgraded grid Batch Edit to sofa-combos pattern:
  useConfirm + 4 fields (payment terms / company / status / rating). Agent `cc0e3fa3`, cherry-picked, shipped `2cbade89`.
- ✅ **Supplier Quotation PDF** — found ALREADY built (`generate-supplier-quotation-pdf.ts` + button on
  supplier detail, shared letterhead). Parked item was stale; nothing to do.
- ✅ **Purchasing Phase D — lineage SmartButtons** — new `PurchaseLineageBar` on PO/GRN/PI detail
  (PO→GRN→PI clickable, counts, client-side derived, read-only). Agent `c91834df`, cherry-picked, shipped `2cbade89`.
- ✅ **GRN list: arrival chips fixed + explicit From PO entry** — (1) arrival filter chips were
  misaligned (dot used `<Badge variant=status>` which renders the status TEXT in a 6px dot →
  overflow/overlap); swapped for a plain `getStatusColor(state).hex` dot. (2) Header only showed
  "Create GRN" though create.tsx already defaults to PO mode → added explicit **From PO / Manual
  Receipt (`?manual=1`) / Scan GRN**. tsc clean, shipped `5bcbbcd3`, **verified live** (chips clean,
  3 buttons present). Found via owner screenshot; fixed via NAVIGATION-MAP (Procurement module).

## 2026-06-20

- ✅ **CoE / Dev-Efficiency System built** — the "big plan" ([DEV-EFFICIENCY-SYSTEM.md](DEV-EFFICIENCY-SYSTEM.md)):
  Layer 4 **Navigation** = [NAVIGATION-MAP.md](context-packs/NAVIGATION-MAP.md) (**15 modules = full system
  coverage**, line-range index for ~30 monster files, spot-verified); Layer 5 **Methodology** = [PLAYBOOKS.md](PLAYBOOKS.md)
  (8 procedures); 9 Codex docs tailored; DOCS-INDEX surfaces all. **Still optional:** light docs reorg
  (merge UI-DATA-DOCUMENT-STANDARDS→UI-CONVENTIONS), Data-dictionary/glossary, ERD map, Test-selection matrix.
- ✅ **#3 / GRN read-bug fix** — dual-key read for snake_case cols folded to camelCase by
  `toCamel`. Shipped `cdfcae69`. **VERIFIED LIVE 2026-06-20:** create→read→delete round-trip on
  prod (`PO-2606-006` throwaway) → `materialCode` stored as "VERIFY-CODE-001" and **read back
  correctly** (was "" before the fix), name clean, deleted 200. GRN arrival reads dual-keyed too.
- ✅ **Employees summary stale-on-date FIX** (task #55) — wired all 6 date-bearing tabs
  (handleSummaryDateChange + onDateChange prop on Efficiency/Dept-Labor/Employee-Detail/
  Dept-Performance/Labor-Cost). Done myself via NAVIGATION-MAP (read ~250 lines not 10,951).
  tsc clean, shipped `4157cf88`, verified-live (renders clean). **SWEEP DONE (2026-06-21, CLEAN):**
  audited dashboard-b month switcher, reports, daily-report, analytics, ~10 accounting date-tabs,
  planning — all correctly put the date in the URL/deps → react. **Employees was the only real
  instance.** 2 minor non-same-class notes: reports.tsx "Generate" gate (change-date-forget-to-click
  → stale display, intentional UX); accounting AR cards mount-once (no date picker). **Task #55 DONE.**
- ✅ **Supplier Pricing → Supplier merge** (task #54) — cherry-picked `5064505c` onto main
  ([Suppliers | Price Comparison] tabs in maintenance.tsx; supplier detail [Pricing & SKUs |
  Price History]; nav "Suppliers"→maintenance; `/procurement/pricing` redirects). Reviewed diff:
  ComparisonTab was PORTED from pricing.tsx → **deleted the now-dead pricing.tsx** so there's one
  comparison surface (no drift). tsc clean. Shipped `b3b42b6c`. **TODO left: verify-live.**
- ✅ **Dev Operating Framework + Work Tracker** — this doc set + the 快准省 / review-
  discipline answer + durable tracking cadence. Committed.
- ✅ **Codex docs read + efficiency framework adopted** — read all context-packs +
  LLM-CONTEXT-STRATEGY + AI-DEVELOPMENT-MODES; saved smallest-mode discipline to memory.

## Parked — needs owner one-line confirm (from 2026-06-18 queue)

- 🟡 Supplier inline **Batch Edit** in grid (scope ambiguous).
- 🟡 Supplier **quotation export / print** (scope ambiguous).
- 🟡 Purchasing **Phase D** — document-flow lineage / SmartButtons (deferred).
